# Maintained projects

### Checkout [TOR Minimal Messaging Protocol - TMMP](https://github.com/FU3X/TMMP)

This is an open source community maintained messaging protocol that routes everything through TOR, end to end encrypted, with the main focus of being incognito. Its completly decenteralized, and each host (same port) can have multiple contained rooms with seperate encryption. It will be light and minimal to keep away bugs and vulnerabilities.
